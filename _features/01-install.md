Miniscule works straight out of the box as a remote theme!

Just set the `remote_theme` in your site's `_config.yml` file:
```yaml
remote_theme: filbertphang/miniscule
```
 
Alternatively, clone the github repository to a local directory and use that as the base for your jekyll site:
```
git clone git@github.com:filbertphang/miniscule.git
```
